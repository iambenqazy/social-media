## Game Development Contractor Matching Service

The development of modern computer games and entertainment software is a challenging and involved process. It brings together many disparate and varied aspects of computing such as graphics, audio, user interfaces, mathematics, physics and high-performance hardware. In addition, it draws on skill sets from not only software programming but also from game design, graphical design, audio engineering, production management, project management and many other areas of expertise.

If you run a large computer games development company, then you may very well have the majority of these skills already embedded within the workforce. However, for smaller companies it is very likely that a portion of the skills required to develop your games are not readily available from your employees. When this is the case such companies will look to hire (usually on fixed length contracts) third party contractors to fill in the skill gaps. For instance, if a development company has an idea for a game that has received funding but they do not have skilled 3D modellers or animators then they can look to specialist in these areas to work for them as contractors.

One of the challenges when working in this way is to establish the contractors that are available and looking for employment on these terms. Sometimes it is inside knowledge of such contractors or even simply word-of-mouth that brings the employer and contractor employees together. Such trusting to luck, however, is at the very least fraught with complications. A better solution would be for the potential employer to reach out somehow to the contractor community at large in search of suitable candidates for inclusion in their game development projects.

One mechanism for achieving this would be to provide a computerised social network-style vehicle for bringing together games companies looking for skilled contractors with those contractors themselves.

## Requirements

This business opportunity requires the development of a computerised system to realise the situation highlighted above. It would need to involve a public social networking approach, probably via a browser-based or mobile platform app which would be backed by a server side web application and database.

The basic operation of this system would involve games companies advertising their need for specific skills they are deficit in and then reaching out to the contractor community allowing suitably skilled contractors to apply to fill those skill gaps. Initially, the system should search through known contractors (finding those suitable for the contract) to see if any could be approached before a more public advertisement is undertaken.

The system should also manage and control the way the company offering the contracts then establishes the actual contractors they will employ. Typically, this will be done through an external application and interview process, but the result of this process must be captured by the system. By capturing this a full audit cycle of advertising the contract, applications for this contract, interviewing to choose the suitable contractor and then the awarding of the contract to a contractor can be recorded (hopefully to aid in the initial search for suitable contractors when similar situations arise). The use of an employer and contractor feedback mechanism should also be considered here to provide objective scoring of the way the contract was undertaken.  

One important aspect of this system is to establish the way it can be monetarised and provide a revenue stream. Some possible avenues here involve the use of subscription for using the system, payments on a contract-by-contract basis and/or advertisement space sold on the presentation screens of the system.
